    <string name="tutorial_back_button">Back</string>
    <string name="tutorial_why_build_app_title">Why Do I Build This App</string>
    <string name="tutorial_why_build_app_paragraph_1">Apparently I would be one of those who got trapped in the digital world spending days and hours surfing and viewing meaningless memes and videos.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_why_build_app_paragraph_2">After somehow discovering 16hrs wasted every week, I eventually made the resolution to build an app that help me track &amp; control.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_why_build_app_paragraph_3">Even though app usage tracking is now a builtin feature in most android distributions, the metrics like launching times &amp; use time and blocking feature that based on use time are not so effective from my view.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_why_build_app_paragraph_4">On one hand, you can easily skip all these Alert &amp; Confirm windows. On the other hand, I believe users should not only be denied till the use time excession but also be denied when they are likely to make an excession.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_why_build_app_paragraph_5">So I designed my own metrics, which would be illustrated in detail in next section.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_title">What are these metrics</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_paragraph_1">The truth is even though I had carried this idea with me for a long time, but honestly never had I found a metric that seems smart enough for me.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_paragraph_2">Until lately I have read Computer Networking : A Top-Down Approach, where I found a model called leaky bucket.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_paragraph_3">The leaky bucket model is initially designed for flow controlling. This analogy is very vivid. In real world, networks should be endowed with the capability to handle massive traffic in a short time. But in the long run, traffic should be limited at an constant average so our networking facilities won\'t be crashed.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_paragraph_4">So let us imagine a leaky bucket, where water flowing into it denotes the constant average limit and water flowing out of it represents the real traffic. This model should happen to work just fine.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_leaky_bucket_model">The Leaky Bucket Model</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_paragraph_5">However, there is a difference between leaky bucket and usage analysis. In usage analysis , we should apply leaky bucket model in a reversed direction (using actual traffic to deduce the water flow and bucket size).</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_paragraph_6">Then we got these metrics:</string>
    <string name="tutorial_use_time_factor">useTimeFactor - the water flow rate (estimated percentage of time spending on apps)</string>
    <string name="tutorial_max_time_factor">maxTimeFactor - the bucket size (in seconds. Denoting the capacity of your app usage \"buffer\")</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_paragraph_7">After defining these two metrics, we are now confronting one more problems. The metrics should change with time. So I took another idea that people are familiar with, EMA(exponential moving average).</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_paragraph_8">The Implementation is simple, factors at this instant should be composed by two parts, factors in the past and new behaviors. And these are what \"Loss Rate\" (honestly it should be called as keeping rate) is for.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_paragraph_9">Then Here comes yet another problem, at the very beginning, all our statistics are 0, and if we set our \"Loss Rate\" to 80%, which means 80% of our metric are determined by that of yesterday, then it would take days to get our metrics to the real condition.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_metrics_paragraph_10">To tackle this issue, a fast start algorithm is introduced. In the early hours (Fast Start Hours), our real loss rate would be multiplied by a fastStartFactor, making it a smaller value, so we can reach the real average in a shorter time.</string>
